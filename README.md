# Event-Temporal-Up-sampling

# Introduction
Generate up-sampling events on the correct motion trajectory, which includes estimating the motion trajectory of the events by contrast maximization algorithm and up-sampling the events by the temporal point processes (Hawkes Process for main events, Self-correcting Process for noise).

## Usage
Change event_path in main.py to your own path.

## Dependencies
python=3.8
